## Analysis and Estimation of Asymmetric Linear Regression Models

In this project, I focused on using variable transformation techniques and estimating linear regression models to tackle common challenges like data skewness, which often arise in real-world scenarios.

I started by importing a dataset containing real estate data from the city of Rio de Janeiro. I conducted preliminary analyses, identifying outliers and evaluating correlations between the dependent and explanatory variables. Additionally, I explored several data transformation techniques, such as logarithmic transformations, and then proceeded to estimate linear regression models.

Afterward, I introduced strategies to deal with everyday challenges that data science professionals encounter. I examined variable transformation techniques, including those for variables that do not have a linear relationship, applying these methods to resolve problems and estimate linear regression models. Moreover, I incorporated formal statistical tests for regression parameters, expanding my analytical toolkit and improving my ability to conduct thorough data analysis.
