## Introduction to Experiment Analysis

This project presents a detailed analysis of a factorial design experiment and its statistical analysis using Python. The experiment involves the production of cupcakes by varying the amounts of flour and chocolate in the recipe. The steps include everything from planning the experiment to constructing statistical models and visualizing the results.

## The steps of the project include:

* Planning experiments for data collection.
* Constructing a factorial design.
* Graphical analysis of the experimental data.
* Fitting statistical models to the data.
* Statistical significance testing of the model parameters.
* Exploration and visualization of the results.
